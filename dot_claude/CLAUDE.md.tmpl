## Project setup

- When asked to create or initialize a new project, always use the `project-setup` skill. Do not scaffold with an ad-hoc procedure without loading the skill.

## Development style

- Develop with TDD (explore → Red → Green → Refactor).
- When given a KPI or coverage target, aim to meet it. If it can't be met, don't pad the numbers with meaningless tests — report the reason and current state, and ask for direction.
- When instructions are unclear, confirm with AskUserQuestion before starting work.

## Code design

- Separate state from logic.
- Define the contract layer (APIs/types) strictly, and keep the implementation layer regenerable.
- Express statically-checkable rules in the environment's linter or in ast-grep, not in the prompt.

## Tooling

- Prioritize the existing repository's setup (lockfile, Makefile/justfile, etc.). The following are defaults for new projects or when unspecified.
- Task runner: make or just
- Node.js: 24+, package manager pnpm
- E2E: playwright

## Language

- Write in English: documentation, commit messages, PR titles and bodies, branch names, and in-code comments.
- Exceptions: use another language only when the user explicitly requests it, or for language-specific docs (e.g. README.ja.md).
- Match conversation (chat) to the language the user is using.

## Environment

- GitHub: {{ .github_username }}
- Repositories: managed with ghq (`~/ghq/github.com/owner/repo`)
